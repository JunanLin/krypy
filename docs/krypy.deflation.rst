:mod:`krypy.deflation` - Linear Systems Solvers with Deflation
==============================================================

The ``deflation`` module provides functions for deflated Krylov subspace
methods. With deflation, a linear system is multiplied with a suitable
projection with the goal of accelerating the overall solution process for the
linear system. This module provides tools that are needed in deflated Krylov
subspace methods such as involved projections and computations of Ritz or
harmonic Ritz pairs from a deflated Krylov subspace.
